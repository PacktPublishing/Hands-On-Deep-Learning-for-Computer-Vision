# Hands-On Deep Learning for Computer Vision [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Deep Learning for Computer Vision [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-deep-learning-computer-vision-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788835503), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Machine Learning and Deep learning techniques, in particular, are changing the way computers see and interact with the world.  From augmented and mixed reality applications to just gathering data, these new techniques are revolutionizing a lot of industries This course is designed to give you a hands-on learning experience by going from the basic concepts to the most current in-depth Deep Learning methods for Computer Vision in use today.
In this course, you will be introduced to the concept of deep learning and a variety of popular & effective techniques for image classification, detection, segmentation and generation. You will learn to build your own neural network and able to classify images accordingly. You will be taken through popular techniques such as style transfer - to transfer styles between images.
By the end of this course, you will be able to use computer vision and deep learning to encode, classify, detect and style images for the real world.
